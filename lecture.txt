pointer is like a treasure for travel in to memomy I want to update like plus minus ...
example

    int originNum = 0; we should always assign initial value if not do it become a garbage
    increase(int *num)
    {
        int += 1;
    }
    increase(&originNum) send address of num for increase
    result is 1

    workflow look like

    originNum -> num
